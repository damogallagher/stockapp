### Playwright E2E Configuration

**File: `/Users/damiengallagher/Development/sourceControl/Personal/Claude/StockApp/playwright.config.ts`**

- Test directory: `./e2e`
- Parallel test execution
- CI-specific configuration (retries, workers)
- Multiple reporters: HTML, JSON, JUnit, GitHub
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Automatic dev server startup
- Trace and screenshot capture on failure
- 30-second test timeout, 10-second assertion timeout

### Test Coverage Configuration

**Jest Coverage:**
- Source: `src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- Excludes: Type definitions, CSS files, config files
- Thresholds: 50% for branches, functions, lines, statements
- Reporters: text, lcov, html
- Output directory: `coverage/`

**E2E Coverage:**
- Configured in CI/CD pipeline
- Separate coverage tracking
- 80% threshold requirement

### CI/CD Test Configuration

**File: `/Users/damiengallagher/Development/sourceControl/Personal/Claude/StockApp/.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml`**

Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with:

**Build Optimization:**
- Parallel job execution
- Extensive caching (node_modules, TypeScript, Jest, Playwright browsers, Next.js builds)
- Conditional dependency installation
- Concurrency control

**Test Jobs:**
1. **Lint & Type Check** - ESLint and TypeScript validation
2. **Unit Tests** - Jest with coverage reporting
3. **E2E Tests** - Playwright cross-browser testing
4. **Coverage Report** - Merged coverage reporting

**Coverage Thresholds:**
- Unit tests: ≥50%
- E2E tests: ≥80%

**Integrations:**
- Codecov for coverage reporting
- PR comments with coverage status
- Artifact uploads for test results

### Current Test Suite

**Unit Tests (23 test files):**
- Components: UI components, stock components, layout components
- Hooks: Custom React hooks
- Utilities: Helper functions, store management
- API: Route handlers and API functions

**E2E Tests (4 test files):**
- Home page functionality
- Stock search functionality
- Watchlist management
- Stock details page

## Available Test Runners and Configurations

### Jest (Unit Testing)
- **Configuration**: `jest.config.js`
- **Setup**: `jest.setup.js`
- **Environment**: JSDOM
- **Features**: Coverage reporting, mocking, TypeScript support

### Playwright (E2E Testing)
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Features**: Cross-browser testing, visual testing, trace collection

### TypeScript
- **Configuration**: Uses project's `tsconfig.json`
- **Type checking**: Separate script for validation

## Missing Dependencies and Setup

### All Essential Dependencies Present
The testing infrastructure is complete with all necessary dependencies:
- ✅ Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright)
- ✅ Testing utilities (@testing-library/react, user-event)
- ✅ Mocking capabilities (MSW, Jest mocks)
- ✅ Coverage reporting (built-in Jest, nyc as backup)
- ✅ TypeScript support

### No Missing Setup Required
The current setup is comprehensive and production-ready.

## Recommendations for Optimal Test Configuration

### 1. Test Organization
- **Current**: Well-organized with separate directories for unit (`__tests__`) and E2E (`e2e`) tests
- **Recommendation**: Continue current structure

### 2. Coverage Reporting
- **Current**: 50% threshold for unit tests, 80% for E2E
- **Recommendation**: Consider gradually increasing unit test threshold to 60-70%

### 3. Test Performance
- **Current**: Optimized with caching and parallel execution
- **Recommendation**: Monitor CI execution time and adjust worker counts if needed

### 4. Mock Data Management
- **Current**: Comprehensive mock data with realistic values
- **Recommendation**: Consider extracting mock data to separate JSON files for easier maintenance

### 5. Test Stability
- **Current**: Good timeout configuration and retry logic
- **Recommendation**: Monitor flaky tests and adjust timeouts as needed

### 6. Additional Testing Tools (Optional)
Consider adding:
- **Visual regression testing**: Playwright has built-in capabilities
- **Performance testing**: Lighthouse CI integration
- **Accessibility testing**: @axe-core/playwright for a11y testing

## Coverage Reporting Setup

### Current Configuration
- **Unit Tests**: Jest built-in coverage with lcov, html, and text reporters
- **E2E Tests**: Configured for coverage collection in CI
- **Merged Reports**: Automatic merging of unit and E2E coverage
- **Integration**: Codecov for coverage tracking and PR comments

### Output Locations
- Unit coverage: `coverage/`
- E2E coverage: `coverage-e2e/`
- Merged coverage: `merged-coverage/`

## Summary

The testing infrastructure is **exceptionally well-configured** with:
- ✅ Complete test dependency management
- ✅ Comprehensive Jest configuration with Next.js integration
- ✅ Robust test setup with extensive mocking
- ✅ Cross-browser E2E testing with Playwright
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline with coverage tracking
- ✅ Proper test organization and utilities
- ✅ Performance optimized execution

This setup provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and ensuring application reliability across all aspects of the React/TypeScript stock application.
